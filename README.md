# UnityPortFate

A Unity port of the single player RPG game orignially coded in PyGame, Booga's Welcome of Fate.

With the port from pygame to Unity, the game has been changed from a turn-based, JRPG-style game to a fully-fledged 2D action RPG. 
Skills now have dynamic effects and cast animations, and both the player and enemy sprites move in real time.
With this transition of genres, players now need to rely on smart positioning and timely usage of skills to defeat perilous enemies.

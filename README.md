# UnityPortFate

A Unity port of the single player RPG game orignially coded in PyGame, Booga's Welcome of Fate.

With the port from pygame to Unity, the game has been changed from a turn-based, JRPG-style game to a fully-fledged 2D action RPG. 
Skills now have dynamic effects and cast animations, and both the player and enemy sprites move in real time.
With this transition of genres, players now need to rely on smart positioning and timely usage of skills to defeat perilous enemies.

The Mage class commands the four elements: Fire, Water, Earth, and Electricity. With control of these destructive powers, the Mage can easily defeat swathes of foes with ease.
However, be aware that the Mage is the class with the lowest defense and mobility; if the Mage is surrounded with no area of effect spells handy, or locked down by crowd control effects, they will surely meet their untimely demise.

Finally, the Warrior class is balanced in both offense and defense. With powerful tools for dueling multiple enemies, and surviving deadly blows, the Warrior can make it out of any situation alive. However, be forewarned that as a jack of all trades, the Warrior lacks the deadly offensive power of the Mage and the mobility of the Rouge classes.
